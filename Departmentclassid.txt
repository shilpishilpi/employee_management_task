2>Department Class:
1>Create a Department class with attributes for department name and a list of employees.

ans=Here's a basic implementation of a Department class in Python:
class Department:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.employees = []

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        self.employees.append(employee)

    def remove_employee(self, employee):
        if employee in self.employees:
            self.employees.remove(employee)
        else:
            print(f"{employee} is not in {self.name} department.")

    def display_employees(self):
        print(f"Employees in {self.name} department:")
        for employee in self.employees:
            print(employee)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Creating a department
    hr_department = Department("HR")

    # Adding employees to the department
    hr_department.add_employee("Alice")
    hr_department.add_employee("Bob")
    hr_department.add_employee("Charlie")

    # Displaying employees in the department
    hr_department.display_employees()

    # Removing an employee from the department
    hr_department.remove_employee("Bob"

    # Displaying employees after removal
    hr_department.display_employees()
===========================================================================================================================================================================
In this implementation:

1>The Department class has attributes for name and employees.
2>There are methods to add_employee, remove_employee, and display_employees.
3>The add_employee method adds an employee to the list of employees in the department.
4>The remove_employee method removes an employee from the list of employees in the department, if they exist.
5>The display_employees method prints out all the employees in the department.

02>Include methods to add an employee, remove an employee, and list all employees in the department.


ans=Sure, here's an updated version of the Department class with methods to add an employee, remove an employee, and list all employees in the department:
=================================================================================================================================================================================
class Department:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.employees = []

    def add_employee(self, employee):
        self.employees.append(employee)

    def remove_employee(self, employee):
        if employee in self.employees:
            self.employees.remove(employee)
            print(f"{employee} has been removed from the {self.name} department.")
        else:
            print(f"{employee} is not in the {self.name} department.")

    def list_employees(self):
        print(f"Employees in the {self.name} department:")
        for employee in self.employees:
            print(employee)


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Creating a department
    hr_department = Department("HR")

    # Adding employees to the department
    hr_department.add_employee("Alice")
    hr_department.add_employee("Bob")
    hr_department.add_employee("Charlie")

    # Listing employees in the department
    hr_department.list_employees()

    # Removing an employee from the department
    hr_department.remove_employee("Bob")

    # Listing employees after removal
    hr_department.list_employees()
========================================================================================================================================================================================
In this version, I've added:

1>remove_employee method that removes an employee from the department's employee list, if they exist, and provides feedback about the removal.
2>list_employees method that prints out all the employees in the department.
